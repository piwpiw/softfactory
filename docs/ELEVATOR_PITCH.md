## 30-Second Pitch (Casual/Quick)

### Version A: The Problem-Solve Hook
"SoftFactory is an all-in-one platform for service entrepreneurs. Instead of juggling 5+ tools—booking system, payment processor, social media scheduler, review management, and automation—we give you all of that in one place for $29-89 a month. Launch your service business in hours instead of weeks."

**Usage:** Elevator, networking events, casual conversation
**Tone:** Friendly, direct
**Hook:** Problem recognition (5 tools = pain)

---

### Version B: The Aspiration Hook
"We built SoftFactory because we got tired of watching amazing service professionals spend more time managing tools than serving their customers. One platform. Chef marketplaces, social automation, AI employees, bootcamp builders. Everything you need to launch and grow. $29 to start."

**Usage:** Investor conversations, founder communities
**Tone:** Mission-driven
**Hook:** Shared frustration with status quo

---

### Version C: The Comparison Hook
"Zapier + Calendly + Hootsuite + Stripe = $300/month and constant integration headaches. SoftFactory? One platform, five services, $29-89/month, and everything talks to each other out of the box."

**Usage:** Product-conscious audiences, tech-savvy founders
**Tone:** Efficiency-focused
**Hook:** Value comparison

## 1-Minute Pitch (Meetings, Demos, Introductions)

### Version A: The Story Arc (Emotion-first)

"A year ago, I met a chef in Seoul. She's amazing at her craft, but she spent 15 hours a week managing bookings in Google Sheets, collecting payments manually, responding to customer inquiries across WhatsApp and Kakao, and trying to grow her business on Instagram. She wasn't alone.

Millions of service professionals—chefs, consultants, coaches, educators—face the same problem: they're forced to choose between serving their customers or managing their tools.

We built SoftFactory to fix that. It's a single platform that combines everything they need: a marketplace for chef bookings, social media automation, review management, AI-powered task automation, and a bootcamp builder for educators.

Here's what's different: it's purpose-built for their needs, not a generic automation tool. Everything integrates natively. It costs $29-89 a month, not $300+. And you can launch your first service in under an hour.

We're at 10,000 users now, with 2,000 active chefs in our marketplace alone. Our customers save an average of $250/month and 12 hours/week of tool-hopping.

We're hiring our Series A and we're betting that the future of work belongs to service entrepreneurs who can move fast."

**Usage:** Investor pitches, company talks, podcasts
**Tone:** Narrative, mission-focused
**Hook:** Customer story that builds empathy

---

### Version B: The Data Arc (Logic-first)

"Here's the market: 50 million service entrepreneurs globally (freelancers, small business owners, educators) spend an average of $300/month on disconnected tools and 15+ hours/week managing them.

The problem: Horizontal platforms like Zapier and Make are designed for enterprises. They require technical expertise, cost $100-1,000/month, and take weeks to set up.

SoftFactory's solution:

**1. Purpose-built services.** Not generic automation—pre-configured modules for their specific needs: chef marketplace (Airbnb for local food), SNS automation (social media on autopilot), review campaigns (influencer management), AI employees (Claude-powered task automation), and bootcamp builder (education delivery).

**2. Integrated by default.** One user system, one payment method, one data warehouse. No APIs breaking. No Zapier overhead.

**3. Solopreneur pricing.** $29-89/month, not $100-1,000/month. No per-API-call charges. All-inclusive.

**4. Launch in hours.** Average time from signup to first revenue: 6 hours. Competitors: 6-8 weeks.

We have 10,000 paying users, $500K ARR, and 90% month-over-month retention. Our fastest-growing cohort: solo chefs and micro-agencies.

The market is $18B. We're going after the underserved $5B SMB segment."

**Usage:** Investor pitches, board meetings, strategic partnerships
**Tone:** Analytical, data-backed
**Hook:** Market opportunity

---

### Version C: The Comparison Arc (Competitive-first)

"The market leader for automation is Zapier—$18B valuation, 5 million users. They've built something powerful, but they've optimized for complexity: 3,000+ integrations, visual workflow builders, enterprise-grade infrastructure.

That works for large companies. But for a solo chef or a small education provider? It's overkill. They need simple. They need fast. They need affordable.

Enter SoftFactory.

We asked: What if we purpose-built a platform for service entrepreneurs? What if we pre-configured the 20% of features that serve 80% of small businesses? What if we made integrations transparent instead of requiring API knowledge?

**Results:**

| Metric | Zapier | Make | n8n | SoftFactory |
|--------|--------|------|-----|-------------|
| Setup time | 2-4 hours | 4-8 hours | 8-20 hours | 15 minutes |
| Monthly cost | $100-1,000 | $10-1,000 | Free-custom | $29-89 |
| Time to revenue | 6-8 weeks | 4-6 weeks | 8-12 weeks | 6 hours |
| Target market | Enterprise | Enterprise | Developers | SMB |
| Chef marketplace | No (via integration) | No (via integration) | No (via integration) | Yes (native) |
| AI automation | Optional ($$ extra) | Optional ($$ extra) | Optional ($$ extra) | Included |

We've defined a new category: **Vertical SaaS for Service Entrepreneurs**.

10,000 users. $500K ARR. 90% retention. And we're just getting started."

**Usage:** Competitive presentations, startup awards, media interviews
**Tone:** Strategic, market-defining
**Hook:** Category creation

## 5-Minute Pitch (Deep-dive, Press, Strategic Partners)

### The Full Narrative

**OPENING (30 seconds):**

"How many service professionals do you know who've started a business? A chef teaching cooking classes. A consultant launching a coaching practice. An educator starting a bootcamp. What's their biggest pain, besides delivering their service? Managing the 5+ tools their business requires.

I'm talking about booking systems, payment processing, social media scheduling, customer communication, review management, content automation. Most of them don't want to be tech experts. They want to focus on their craft.

SoftFactory is the platform that lets them do that."

**THE PROBLEM (1 minute):**

"Let's paint a picture. You're a freelance chef in Seoul. You're incredible at your craft—client testimonials, a waitlist, word-of-mouth momentum. But you're drowning in admin:

- Google Sheets for bookings (no confirmation, no payments)
- Manual email back-and-forth
- Stripe dashboard for payments (2.9% + $0.30 fees, no invoice history)
- WhatsApp for customer service
- Kakao for marketing messages
- Instagram for portfolio
- Excel for financials

You're spending 15+ hours/week managing this mess. It costs you $150-250/month in subscription services. Your actual hourly rate? Maybe $20-30/week after tool costs.

This is the reality for 50 million service professionals globally. They're not trying to build the next Netflix—they're trying to run a simple, profitable service business.

And the solutions available? Disconnected. Complicated. Expensive.

Zapier is designed for enterprises with dev teams. Make is beautiful but requires 40+ hours of setup. Calendly is just booking, not the full business. There's no platform built specifically for people like our chef."

**THE SOLUTION (1.5 minutes):**

"We built SoftFactory from the ground up for service entrepreneurs.

**Here's what you get:**

1. **Chef Marketplace Module** — Customers can book directly, payment is automatic, confirmation is instant. Marketplace discovery lets other customers find you. You get 5-star reviews. Fully integrated with booking, payment, and review management.

2. **SNS Auto Module** — You dump your content ideas, SoftFactory schedules posts across Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, LinkedIn. No creative work—our AI team handles the copy. 30 posts scheduled in 30 minutes.

3. **Review & Campaign Module** — You want influencer testimonials? You define the brief, we handle recruitment, we track applications, influencers submit reviews. One interface for your entire influencer program.

4. **AI Employees Module** — Your AI customer service agent responds to inquiries 24/7. Qualifies leads. Schedules follow-ups. Learns from feedback. Like hiring a $50K/year employee for $89/month.

5. **WebApp Builder Module** — Want to launch a bootcamp or online course? One-click website. Student enrollment. Payment collection. Curriculum delivery. Cohort management. All built-in.

**Here's the secret sauce:** These aren't bolted-together integrations. They share a data model. One user system. One payment system. One analytics dashboard. Data flows naturally because it's designed to flow.

You get:
- Single login
- Single invoice ($29-89/month, all services)
- Cross-service analytics (revenue by service type, customer lifetime value, etc.)
- Zero API breaking (we control the stack)
- Zero integration overhead (no Zapier required)"

**THE PROOF (1 minute):**

"Here are the numbers:

**Traction:**
- 10,000 paying users (Q1 2026)
- $500K ARR
- 2,000 active chefs in marketplace
- 90% month-over-month retention
- 45% month-over-month growth

**Customer impact:**
- Average time from signup to first booking: 6 hours (vs. 6-8 weeks with traditional approach)
- Average monthly cost savings: $250 (Zapier + Calendly + Hootsuite combo costs $150+)
- Average time savings: 12 hours/week (tool consolidation + automation)

**Market validation:**
- Fastest-growing cohorts: solo chefs (32% of user base), micro-agencies (28%), educators (18%)
- Net Promoter Score: 71 (industry average: 45)
- Win rate vs. traditional combo: 85%
- Cost per acquisition: $35 (organic, word-of-mouth)

We're profitable on unit economics. We're reinvesting to scale. We've turned down 3 acquisition offers."

**THE ASK (1 minute):**

"We're raising $5M Series A to:

1. **Expand the platform** — Add 5 more service modules (fitness, consulting, photography, beauty, entertainment)
2. **Global launch** — Localize for APAC, EMEA, LATAM (32% of signups are non-US, 45% non-English)
3. **Mobile apps** — iOS/Android for on-the-go management
4. **Enterprise tier** — SSO, advanced admin, priority support for mid-market
5. **Strategic partnerships** — Integrations with Stripe, Shopify, Google Workspace, etc.

We're not trying to be Zapier 2.0. We're defining a new category: **purpose-built platforms for service entrepreneurs**. It's a $5B market within the $18B automation market.

We have founder-market fit. We have product-market fit. We have unit economics that work. What we need is fuel to scale.

We're looking for partners who believe in the future of work—not for enterprises, but for the 50 million service professionals who just want to run their business without becoming a CTO.

That's SoftFactory."

## Tips for Delivery

1. **Personalize.** The best pitch addresses the listener's specific concern. Investor? Emphasize unit economics. Customer? Focus on time savings.

2. **Tell a story.** Data persuades, but stories move. Start with a customer, not a problem.

3. **Use pauses.** Don't rush. Let key points land.

4. **Practice the opening.** The first 30 seconds determine if someone leans in or checks their phone.

5. **Watch for signals.** If someone's eyes glaze over, pivot. Skip the 5-minute version and jump to Q&A.

6. **Be specific.** "6 hours to first booking" beats "fast." "$250/month savings" beats "affordable."

7. **Acknowledge the question.** "Great question..." makes people feel heard.

8. **End with a question.** "What would change if you could launch a service business in a day instead of a quarter?" Engagement > monologue.

9. **Know your numbers.** If you're vague on metrics, you lose credibility.

10. **Believe it.** Conviction is contagious. You need to actually believe this solves a real problem.
