## Pricing Model Comparison

### Option A: Flat Service-Based (SELECTED)
- $29 for 1 service, $49 for 2, $89 for all
- **Pros:** Simple to understand, easy to upgrade, matches customer perception
- **Cons:** Less granular revenue capture, doesn't reward high-volume usage

### Option B: Task/Operation Based (Zapier Model)
- $100/mo for 100 tasks, $500 for 1,000
- **Pros:** Scales with usage, aligns cost with value
- **Cons:** Confusing for SMBs, unpredictable bills, customers hate it

### Option C: Per-User Model
- $15 per user per month + base fee
- **Pros:** Scales with team size, common in SaaS
- **Cons:** Deters small teams, doesn't reflect actual usage

### Option D: Usage-Based (Future)
- $29 base + $0.01 per booking + $0.05 per social post
- **Pros:** Perfect price discrimination, revenue scales with value
- **Cons:** Complex billing, requires sophisticated analytics

**Recommendation:** Start with Service-Based (Option A), migrate to Hybrid (Service-Based + Usage-Based) at Enterprise tier in 2027.

## Revenue Model Assumptions

### Pricing Tiers Distribution (First Year Targets)

| Tier | % of Customers | ARPU | Contribution |
|------|----------------|------|--------------|
| Starter | 30% | $29 | 13% |
| Pro | 45% | $64* | 52% |
| Business | 20% | $89 | 30% |
| Enterprise | 5% | $900 | 12% |

*Pro average: $49 base + $15 AI add-on + annual discount

---

### Upgrade Path Revenue Model

**Assumption:** Customers follow this upgrade path
- **Month 1:** Starter (trial mostly)
- **Month 3:** 60% upgrade to Pro, 20% to Business, 20% stay/churn
- **Month 6:** 50% of Pro upgrade to Business
- **Month 12:** 30% of Business upgrade to Enterprise

**Example Customer Lifetime Value (LCV):**
```
Starter Month 1: $29
Pro Month 3-6: $49 × 4 = $196
Business Month 6-12: $89 × 6 = $534
Enterprise Month 12+: $699 × 12+ = $8,388

Total Year 1: $759
Year 2+: $8,388 (annual)

LCV (3 years, 80% retention): $759 + $8,388 × 2 × 0.8 = $14,180
Gross margin (85%): $12,053
CAC payback (target <12 months): Payback at month 11

## Competitive Price Responses

- Highlight integration quality, not just cost

**If Make becomes cheaper:**
- Emphasize ease of use and pre-built solutions
- Don't engage in price war (race to bottom)

**If competitor copies our vertical model:**
- Move upmarket to enterprise
- Expand to adjacent verticals (fitness, beauty, photography)
- Build community/network effects

## Pricing FAQ for Sales Team

**Q: "Can I get a discount?"**
A: "Our pricing is already 60% cheaper than the alternatives. But if you're committing to annual, that's 15% off. Or if you're a non-profit, we do 50% off."

**Q: "What if we outgrow a tier?"**
A: "Great question! Customers typically hit feature limits and upgrade naturally. We'll proactively suggest when that happens. Custom limits are negotiable at Enterprise level."

**Q: "Do you have educational/volume discounts?"**
A: "Yes—40% for students/educators, and we negotiate volume pricing at Enterprise. Let me intro you to our sales team for that conversation."

**Q: "Why can't I add more users?"**
A: "Starter is designed for individuals testing. Pro allows 3 users, Business allows 10. If you need unlimited, Enterprise is the right fit."

**Q: "Is the Enterprise pricing negotiable?"**
A: "Absolutely. It depends on your use case, team size, and integration needs. Let's talk to our enterprise team."

## Conclusion

SoftFactory's pricing strategy is designed to:
1. **Be simple** — 4 tiers, easy to explain
2. **Be fair** — 60% cheaper than alternatives for equivalent functionality
3. **Scale revenue** — Upgrade path captures growing demand

**Expected outcome:** $8.5M ARR by end of Year 1, profitability by Year 2, $50M ARR by Year 5.
