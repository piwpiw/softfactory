## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Which document should I read first?**
A: Start with `MARKET_LAUNCH_SUMMARY.md` for 10-min overview, then dive into your role-specific documents.

**Q: How often should we review these documents?**
A: Monthly post-launch. Many assumptions will need validation; stay flexible.

**Q: What if we don't hit a milestone?**
A: Don't panic. Review what went wrong, adjust channels, try again. Learning is more important than hitting targets early.

**Q: Can we change pricing?**
A: Not during launch week. But do A/B test after 4 weeks of data. Track sensitivity carefully.

**Q: What if a partnership falls through?**
A: Partnerships are nice-to-have, not critical. Your organic + paid channels should carry you.

**Q: Who's responsible for each document?**
A: VP Marketing owns messaging + collateral. VP Sales owns playbook. CEO/Ops owns timeline + checklist.
