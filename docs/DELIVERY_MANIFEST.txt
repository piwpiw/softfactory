================================================================================
                        KEY ACHIEVEMENTS
================================================================================

ELIMINATED DUPLICATIONS
   Before: Guidelines scattered in CLAUDE.md + project docs
   After:  Single MASTER_SYSTEM.md as source of truth
   Result: One set of rules (R1-R10), not scattered

UNIFIED DECISION AUTHORITY
   Before: Unclear who decides what
   After:  Clear escalation → 01-Dispatcher (final authority)
   Result: Fast, decisive processes

SHARED INFRASTRUCTURE
   Before: Each project creating own standards
   After:  7 standard templates in docs/standards/
   Result: Consistency, faster documentation

REAL-TIME VISIBILITY
   Before: Project status scattered across emails
   After:  PROJECT_REGISTRY.md with live metrics
   Result: One dashboard for all stakeholders

TEAM SKILL TRANSPARENCY
   Before: Unclear who could cover for whom
   After:  TEAM_STRUCTURE.md with backup matrix
   Result: Better resource allocation

COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL
   Before: Ad-hoc escalations, confusion
   After:  QUICK_REFERENCE.md + ConsultationBus protocol
   Result: Faster decisions, less thrashing

================================================================================
                          10 GLOBAL RULES (R1-R10)
================================================================================

All agents follow these rules (documented once in MASTER_SYSTEM.md):

R1  Sequential Thinking       - All agents think step-by-step before hand-off
R2  Conflict Escalation       - All conflicts → 01-Dispatcher immediately
R3  Consultation Protocol     - Uncertainty >70% → mandatory ConsultationBus
R4  Template Compliance       - All formal outputs use standard templates
R5  Secret Management         - Secrets ONLY in .env, never in code
R6  Knowledge Sharing         - All discoveries shared weekly
R7  RACI Clarity             - Every task has clear owner + stakeholders
R8  Skill-First Matching     - Match tasks to agent's top 3 skills
R9  Code Quality Gates       - 80%+ test coverage, 0C/0H security
R10 Retrospectives           - Every completed mission → retro session

Benefits:
- One set of rules (not scattered)
- Applied consistently (no exceptions)
- Documented once (easy to update)
- Easy to remember (only 10)
