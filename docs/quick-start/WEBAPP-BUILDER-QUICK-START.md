## 💡 Pro Tips for Website Success

### **Tip 1: High-Quality Images**
- Use professional photos, not stock images
- Minimum 1200px wide for best quality
- Optimize file size (< 200KB per image)
- Use consistent style/color palette

### **Tip 2: Clear, Benefit-Focused Copy**
```
DON'T: "We provide web development services"
DO: "Build your online presence in 2 weeks.
     Our websites convert visitors to customers."

Formula:
├─ What you do
├─ How fast
├─ What customer gets (benefit)
└─ Call to action (what to do next)
```

### **Tip 3: Mobile-First Design**
- Test on phone first (most visitors use phones)
- Tap-friendly buttons (48px+ size)
- Fast load times (compress images)
- No pop-ups on mobile (annoying)

### **Tip 4: Strong Call-to-Action Buttons**
```
Weak: "Click Here"
Better: "Get Your Free Consultation"
Best: "Book Your Free 30-Min Consultation"

Button placement:
├─ Hero section (top)
├─ End of each service
├─ Contact form section
└─ Footer (bottom)
```

### **Tip 5: SEO Optimization**
Make your site findable on Google:

```
Page Title: "Digital Marketing Agency - Local Service"
(Include keywords + keep < 60 characters)

Page Description: "Get professional digital marketing help.
We help small businesses grow online. Free consultation!"
(150-160 characters, includes keywords)

Headings: Use H1 for main title only, H2 for sections
(Google loves proper heading hierarchy)

Keywords to include:
├─ Your service (e.g., "web development")
├─ Your location (e.g., "New York")
└─ Customer problem (e.g., "needs website")
```
