## 💡 Pro Tips for Successful Campaigns

### **Tip 1: Choose Right Reviewers**
- **Niche Fit:** Food reviewers for food, fashion influencers for clothing
- **Audience Size:** 5K-100K followers (sweet spot for authenticity + reach)
- **Quality Track Record:** Look for detailed, helpful previous reviews
- **Engagement Rate:** Higher is better (means their audience trusts them)

### **Tip 2: Clear Campaign Description**
```
GOOD: "We want honest feedback on our new yoga
mat. It's eco-friendly, non-slip, and comes with
a travel bag. Test it for 2 weeks in your
practice. We're looking for detailed feedback
on durability, grip, and comfort."

BAD: "Test our product and tell us if you like it."
```

### **Tip 3: Fair Compensation**
- **$0 (free product only):** For big influencers, cheap products
- **$50-$100:** Standard rate for 5K-50K followers
- **$200-$500:** Major influencers, big products
- **Tip:** Mix free products + cash = happier reviewers

### **Tip 4: Timeline Strategy**
- **Testing Period:** 2-4 weeks minimum (short = shallow reviews)
- **Application Window:** 7-14 days (enough time to find reviewers)
- **Review Submission:** 1-2 weeks after testing ends
- **Example:**
  ```
  Mar 1: Campaign launches
  Mar 1-7: Reviewers apply
  Mar 8: Approvals close, shipping begins
  Mar 8-15: Products arrive at reviewers
  Mar 15-Apr 5: Testing period (3 weeks)
  Apr 6-20: Reviews submitted & approved
  Apr 20: Campaign ends, payments issued
  ```

### **Tip 5: Quality Over Quantity**
- 5 detailed, honest reviews > 50 generic reviews
- Reviewers with smaller audiences often provide better feedback
- Niche reviewers reach MORE relevant audience
- One great review beats 10 mediocre ones

### **Tip 6: Leverage Reviews for Marketing**
- [ ] Feature best reviews on homepage
- [ ] Share to social media (give credit)
- [ ] Include in email campaigns
- [ ] Add to product pages
- [ ] Request permission to use in ads
- [ ] Create video testimonials

## 📞 Common Questions

**Q: What if I don't like the reviews I'm getting?**

**Q: Can I create multiple campaigns at once?**
> Yes! Run 2-3 campaigns on different products simultaneously.

**Q: When do reviewers get paid?**
> System auto-transfers payment 7 days after review is approved. You fund it upfront.

**Q: Can reviewers edit their reviews?**
> Yes, before campaign end date. You'll see "Edited 2 days ago" note.

**Q: How do I use reviews for marketing?**
> Reviews automatically appear on your campaign page. Click "Share" to post to social. Always credit the reviewer!

**Q: What if a reviewer says something negative?**
> That's honest feedback! Use it to improve. Authenticity builds trust with potential customers.
