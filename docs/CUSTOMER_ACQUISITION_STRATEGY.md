## Contingency Plans

**If paid ads CAC exceeds $50:**
→ Shift budget to organic content + partnerships

**If organic growth stalls:**
→ Increase influencer spending + podcast sponsorships

**If partnerships underperform:**
→ Focus on direct sales to agencies + bootcamp networks

**If content isn't driving traffic:**
→ Hire external content agency, shift to paid distribution

---

## Conclusion

This multi-channel approach distributes risk while maintaining focus. No single channel is required for success—each channel contributes 15-27% of customers. If one channel underperforms, the others can compensate.

**The key leverage points:**
1. **Content** is the foundation (builds SEO, attracts inbound)
2. **Organic referral loop** compounds over time
3. **Paid ads** provide immediate, predictable growth
4. **Partnerships** amplify reach with credibility
5. **Community** creates switching costs and loyalty

With disciplined execution, SoftFactory can hit 10,000 customers by Month 12 with a blended CAC of $25 or better.
