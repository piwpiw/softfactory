# ADR-0001: Adopt Clean Architecture with Modular Monolith for CooCook MVP

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** PROPOSED | ACCEPTED | DEPRECATED | SUPERSEDED BY ADR-XXXX
**Author:** Agent 04 / Solution-Architect

## Status
ACCEPTED

---

## Context
> What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

CooCook needs to deliver MVP quickly while maintaining architectural integrity. Team is small (3-5 devs). We need a structure that prevents spaghetti code but doesn't over-engineer with premature microservices.

---

## Decision
> What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

Use Clean Architecture (Domain → Use Cases → Interface Adapters → Frameworks) within a single deployable unit (modular monolith). Bounded Contexts map to Python packages. Extract to microservices when a context exceeds 2 devs or 10k req/min.

---

## Consequences
> What becomes easier or more difficult because of this change?

### Positive
- (list positive consequences)

### Negative
- (list trade-offs and drawbacks)

### Neutral
- (list neutral impacts)

Positive: Fast iteration, single deployment, easy debugging.
Negative: Eventual service extraction requires careful refactoring.
Neutral: Team must be disciplined about layer dependency rules.

---

## Alternatives Considered

Option A: Microservices from day 1 — rejected (premature complexity for 3-dev team).
Option B: Django monolith — rejected (no boundary enforcement without Clean Architecture).
