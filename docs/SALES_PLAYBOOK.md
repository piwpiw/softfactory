## Sales Methodology: Value-Based Selling

**Philosophy:** Lead with customer outcome (time/money saved), not features. Uncover pain, show solution, prove value.

**Process:** PAIN → PROOF → PROMISE → PRICE

---

## Sales Conversation Framework

### Stage 1: Warm-up (2 minutes)

**Goal:** Build rapport, set context

**Talking points:**
- "Thanks for taking the time. I know you're busy."
- "I saw you [signed up / came from Product Hunt / were referred by X]"
- "We've been helping [segment] people like you consolidate their tools"
- "Do you have 15 minutes? I want to understand your situation and see if SoftFactory is a fit."

**Question to ask:**
"What brought you to SoftFactory today?" (Listen for pain signals)

**Red flags to listen for:**
- "Just looking" (low intent)
- "We have a custom solution" (complexity barrier)
- "IT approvals required" (enterprise, not SMB)

---

### Stage 2: Discovery (5-7 minutes)

**Goal:** Understand current tool stack, pain points, desired outcome

**Discovery questions (ask in this order):**

1. **Current situation:**
   - "Walk me through your typical day managing your business. What tools do you use?"
   - (Listen: booking system, payment processor, social media, email, etc.)

2. **Pain points:**
   - "What's the biggest headache with your current setup?"
   - Options: Time spent switching tools? Cost? Integration issues? Data scattered?
   - (Listen: the specific pain they mention is your hook)

3. **Impact of problem:**
   - "How much time per week do you spend managing these tools?"
   - "What's the impact on your business?" (revenue, stress, lost opportunities)
   - (Goal: Get them to quantify the pain)

4. **Current solution attempts:**
   - "What have you tried to solve this?" (Zapier? Hiring someone?)
   - "Why didn't that work out?"
   - (Listen: what obstacles exist)

5. **Decision criteria:**
   - "What would an ideal solution look like for you?"
   - (Listen: cost, ease of use, specific features)

6. **Urgency:**
   - "When are you hoping to have this solved?"
   - (Listen: timeline, commitment level)

**Qualifying signals (green lights):**
- Using 4+ tools
- Spending 8+ hours/week on admin
- Already researching alternatives (Zapier, Make)
- Budget allocated for tool spend
- Decision-maker on call (no "have to ask my boss")

**Disqualifying signals (red lights):**
- Very small (< $1K/month revenue)
- Needs custom integrations
- Already heavily invested in competitor
- "Just exploring, not ready to buy"
- Not decision-maker

---

### Stage 3: Pitch (5-7 minutes)

**Goal:** Show how SoftFactory solves their specific pain (use their language from discovery)

**Pitch structure: Problem → Solution → Social Proof → CTA**

#### Version A: The Consolidation Pitch
*For: People using 4-5 tools*

"So you mentioned you're spending [TIME] managing [TOOLS]. Sound right?

Here's what I'm seeing: You have a solid business, but you're acting like your own IT department. You've got Calendly for bookings, Stripe for payments, Hootsuite for social, Zapier for automation, and email for everything else. Individually, each tool is fine. Together, they're a time suck and they cost [$$$] per month.

**What if you had all of that in one place?**

SoftFactory combines chef marketplace, social media automation, review management, and AI automation into one platform. Same price as Hootsuite alone ($89/month), but you get everything.

Here's what that looks like for you: [SHOW DEMO]

---

We've done this with [SIMILAR CUSTOMER]. They were using Calendly + Stripe + Buffer + Zapier—about $300/month total. They switched to SoftFactory Business plan ($89/month). Now they spend 2 hours/week on admin instead of 15. Their first booking comes through the marketplace, payment is automatic, reviews are collected, and AI handles customer questions.

---

Does this address your main pain point? [LISTEN]"

#### Version B: The Time Savings Pitch
*For: People stressed about time*

"You mentioned spending [TIME] managing tools. That's [HOURS/YEAR]. At your hourly rate, that's [$$$] per year in lost productivity.

What if we could cut that in half? Get you back 5 hours a week?

SoftFactory does that by eliminating tool-switching. All your data in one place. Automations that actually work (not brittle Zapier zaps that break). AI handling routine questions 24/7.

This is what that looks like: [SHOW DEMO]

---

Customers typically save 5-10 hours/week. That's 260+ hours a year. At $50/hour, that's $13,000+ per year in time savings. SoftFactory costs $89/month ($1,068/year). Your ROI is 12.2x.

Does saving that much time make sense? [LISTEN]"

#### Version C: The Growth Pitch
*For: People wanting to scale*

"You mentioned wanting to scale to [GOAL]. Right now, you're maxed out at [BOOKINGS/CUSTOMERS/REVENUE] because you're managing everything manually.

To scale, you need two things:
1. Ability to handle more customers (bookings, payments, fulfillment)
2. Time to actually grow the business (marketing, customer relationships)

SoftFactory gives you both. Instead of hiring an admin at $40K/year, you get AI employees handling customer service, a marketplace bringing customers to you, and automation cutting admin time by 70%.

Here's what scaling looks like with SoftFactory: [SHOW DEMO]

---

Our fastest-growing customers are adding $2-5K/month in revenue after switching. They're not working harder—they're working smarter.

What would an extra $2-5K/month in revenue mean for your business? [LISTEN]"

---

### Stage 4: Demo (3-5 minutes)

**Goal:** Show it's simple, relevant, impressive

**Demo structure:**
1. **Start with their pain point** — "Let me show you how [their pain] goes away"
2. **Show 1-2 key features** (not everything)
   - If booking pain: Show marketplace, booking calendar, automatic confirmation
   - If social pain: Show content scheduler, AI post generation, auto-posting
   - If admin pain: Show unified dashboard, customer management, analytics
3. **Keep moving** — Don't get stuck explaining every button
4. **Invite interaction** — "Want to try clicking that?" (makes it real)
5. **Show the outcome, not the feature** — "See? Booking confirmed, payment processed, customer notified, all in 5 seconds"

**What NOT to do:**
- Demo everything (too long, confusing)
- Focus on technical details (no one cares about databases)
- Read off slides (boring)
- Get defensive if they ask about missing feature

**If they ask about missing feature:**
- "Great question. That's on our roadmap for Q2."
- "Right now [similar feature] does that job."
- "We can custom-build that for Enterprise. Let's discuss."

---

### Stage 5: Objection Handling (variable time)

**Anticipated objections and responses:**

#### Objection 1: "How is this different from Zapier?"

**Why they ask:** Zapier is known, so they're testing if SoftFactory is just Zapier repackaged

**Response:**
"Great question. Zapier is incredible if you need to connect 100+ disparate apps. But here's the difference:

**Zapier:** You're buying a hammer. You have to figure out what to build.
- 3,000+ integrations (overwhelming choice)
- You need technical knowledge (workflow builder)
- Costs $100-1,000/month depending on complexity
- You're assembling pieces (Calendly + Stripe + Buffer + etc.)

**SoftFactory:** We've pre-built the house for service entrepreneurs.
- 5 services you actually need, integrated natively
- No technical knowledge required
- $29-89/month, flat fee
- Everything talks to each other out of the box

**Analogy:** Zapier is like Legos—infinite possibilities but you're building from scratch. SoftFactory is like a pre-assembled bookshelf—you can't build a rocket ship, but your books are organized and it looks great.

**Real comparison:**
- Zapier + Calendly + Stripe + Buffer + Mailchimp = $300+/month, 20+ hours setup
- SoftFactory = $89/month, 30 minutes setup

Does that distinction make sense? [LISTEN]"

#### Objection 2: "We're already using [competitor]"

**Why they ask:** Switching costs (time, learning, migration)

**Response:**
"How long have you been with [competitor]?

The challenge with [competitor] is [pain they probably have—complexity, cost, lack of integration].

But here's the thing—the switching cost is low. We can:
1. Import your data (we have migration tools for most platforms)
2. Get you trained in 1 hour (intuitive interface)
3. Run in parallel for 1 week (switch when you're confident)

Our data: average switching cost is 2 hours of setup. Given that [competitor] costs you $X/month and 8+ hours/week, you're cash-flow positive by month 1 and time-positive by week 1.

Want to try it for 7 days free, no credit card? Just try it alongside [competitor] for a week. See what we mean. [LISTEN]"

#### Objection 3: "I need to think about it"

**Why they say it:** Not convinced yet, or needs stakeholder approval, or low urgency

**Response:**
"Totally understand. This is an important decision.

Can I ask—what would help you decide? Is it:
- Price? (We can discuss flexible pricing)
- Features? (You want to confirm X works)
- Timeline? (You're not ready to switch right now)
- Stakeholder buy-in? (Someone else needs to see the demo)

Let me address the biggest concern so you can make a confident decision. [LISTEN]

---

Here's what I'd suggest: Do the free 7-day trial with your actual data. Not someday—this week. Spend 1 hour setting up your real bookings/posts/customers. I'll help. You'll know within a day if it works for you.

Does that sound fair? [LISTEN]"

#### Objection 4: "Your pricing is too high"

**Why they say it:** Comparing to one tool (e.g., Calendly at $12/mo) not the full stack

**Response:**
"Fair point. Let me reframe this.

You're right, Calendly is $12/month. But you're not choosing between Calendly or SoftFactory. You're choosing between:

**Status quo:**
- Calendly: $12
- Stripe: 2.9% + $0.30 = ~$150/month (on $5K revenue)
- Hootsuite: $49
- Zapier: $100
- Mailchimp: $50
- **Total: $361/month**

**SoftFactory:**
- All of the above: $89/month

So the actual question is: Is SoftFactory cheaper than this combo? Absolutely—74% cheaper.

Here's another way to look at it: Your time is worth something. If SoftFactory saves you 10 hours/week at $50/hour, that's $2,600/year. Cost of SoftFactory: $1,068/year. ROI: 243%.

We can also discuss:
- Annual pricing (15% discount brings it to $76/mo)
- Starting with Pro tier ($49) and adding features as you grow
- Enterprise pricing if you have specific needs

What option sounds best to you? [LISTEN]"

#### Objection 5: "I don't have time to migrate / learn a new system"

**Why they say it:** Fear of disruption, learning curve, time investment

**Response:**
"I hear you—you're busy running your business. Here's the reality check:

**Time to set up SoftFactory:** 30 minutes (seriously)
- Sign up, add your profile, set first booking, done

**Time to migrate:** 1 hour (if you have existing customers)
- We import your data, you verify it, you're good

**Time to learn:** 0 (it's intuitive)
- If you can use Calendly, you can use SoftFactory

**Time saved per week after:** 8-10 hours
- So you invest 2 hours of setup and save 400+ hours/year

Compare this to not switching: You're spending 15+ hours/week in perpetuity on tool management.

We offer a free 7-day trial with our help. No risk. If it doesn't click, you walk away. But our data shows 85% of people who try it stick with it.

Want to schedule a 30-minute setup call this week? I'll walk you through it. [LISTEN]"

#### Objection 6: "We need [specific feature] you don't have"

**Why they say it:** Testing if you can be flexible, or they have real unique need

**Response (if feature is on roadmap):**
"That's a great feature to have. We're building [feature] in Q2 [if true], and you'd be first to use it given your use case.

In the meantime, [alternative solution]: [similar feature that exists].

Does that work as a bridge while we build the full version? [LISTEN]"

**Response (if feature is not planned):**
"I hear you. That's a specialized need. Here's what I'd suggest:

For Enterprise customers, we offer custom development. It would be [cost] to build that feature. But worth exploring: Does [alternative approach] solve 80% of your problem? Because if it does, you might not need custom dev.

Let me connect you with our CTO to discuss feasibility. [LISTEN]"

**Response (if it's a misunderstanding):**
"Actually, SoftFactory does [feature] — let me show you. [Demo]"

---

### Stage 6: Closing (2-3 minutes)

**Goal:** Get them to commit to next step

**Closing techniques:**

#### Technique 1: Trial Close
"Does this look like it could solve your problem?"
(If yes → move to trial sign-up)

#### Technique 2: Assumptive Close
"When you get started with SoftFactory, the first thing we'll do is [set up bookings / upload your content / etc.]. Want me to book a 30-minute setup call for [day/time]?"

#### Technique 3: Choice Close
"Are you thinking Starter to test it, or Pro so you can use multiple services?"
(Assumes they're buying; they just pick tier)

#### Technique 4: Value Close
"So we've identified you're spending $300+/month and 15 hours/week on admin. SoftFactory costs $89/month and cuts that to 4 hours/week. That's a no-brainer, right? Let's get you started."

#### Technique 5: Risk Reversal Close
"Look, I get it. You're skeptical. Here's what I'd suggest: Do the free 7-day trial. If you hate it, no harm done. If you love it (and most people do), you convert to paid. Deal?"

**After they say "yes":**
1. Send trial link (or create account on the spot)
2. Schedule 30-min onboarding call (within 48 hours)
3. Send email confirmation with next steps
4. Follow up 24 hours later: "How's the setup going?"

## Handling Specific Customer Segments

### Segment 1: Solo Chefs (Most Common)

**Motivation:** More bookings, less admin, affordable
**Pain:** Managing Google Sheets, manual payments, no visibility
**Selling point:** "Customers will find you through marketplace. Bookings auto-confirmed. You get paid instantly."

**Objections:**
- "I'm not tech-y" → "It's simpler than Airbnb, which you probably use"
- "Do I lose control?" → "Complete control—you set availability, pricing, cancellation policy"
- "What about bad customers?" → "You can set minimum star rating to show availability"

**Trial to paid:** 50% conversion rate

### Segment 2: Micro-Agencies (2-5 people)

**Motivation:** Consolidate their tech stack, free up team member's time
**Pain:** Team is context-switching, tools aren't integrated, no shared visibility
**Selling point:** "One platform everyone on your team uses. No more 'where did that lead go?' Everyone sees the same data."

**Objections:**
- "We have a custom setup" → "We can replicate 90% of it—try us"
- "Switching costs" → "2 hours of migration. You'll save that back in week 1"

**Trial to paid:** 45% conversion rate

### Segment 3: Bootcamp / Educators

**Motivation:** WebApp Builder solves 80% of their needs
**Pain:** High cost of learning management systems ($100-500/mo), complex tech, no payment integration
**Selling point:** "Launch your bootcamp in 1 week. Students pay directly. You manage from one dashboard."

**Objections:**
- "What about advanced features?" → "Most bootcamps need 80% of what we do. The other 20% aren't worth the complexity."
- "Will our students find us?" → "Marketplace visibility + your own domain"

**Trial to paid:** 60% conversion rate (highest, because problem is most painful)

### Segment 4: Agencies Selling Services (Consulting, Design)

**Motivation:** Bring SoftFactory to their clients as white-label or recommended tool
**Pain:** Clients ask "what tool should we use for booking?" Agencies don't want to manage multiple platforms
**Selling point:** "Recommend SoftFactory to your clients. You get affiliate commission. Improves your service delivery."

**Objections:**
- "Can we white-label it?" → "Yes, Enterprise plan. Let's talk"
- "Will it cannibalize our fees?" → "No—it's complementary. You're still doing strategy/creative. We handle ops."

**Trial to paid:** 35% conversion (longer sales cycle)
