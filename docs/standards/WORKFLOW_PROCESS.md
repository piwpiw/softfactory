> **Version:** 2.0 | **Governance:** v3.0 | **Updated:** 2026-02-25

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for all agent workflows, task handoffs, and decision gates.

## 1. Project Initiation Workflow

### **Step 1: Project Proposal**
**Input:** User provides project description
**Owner:** Orchestrator Agent
**Time:** 5 minutes

```
IF user_input.clarity < HIGH:
  → Ask 2 clarifying questions
  → Wait max 3 minutes for response
ELSE:
  → Parse requirements
  → Identify risks
  → Estimate scope
  → Output: Structured brief
```

**Output Deliverable:**
- Structured requirements (JSON/markdown)
- Risk register (3-5 key risks)
- Estimated effort (hours)
- Recommended agent sequence

**Gate:** Orchestrator approves structured brief → advance

---

### **Step 2: Pre-Flight Checks**
**Owner:** Orchestrator + Security Auditor
**Time:** 10 minutes

```
PARALLEL checks:
├─ Tech stack validation (matches platform standards)
├─ Security threat model (OWASP Top 10)
├─ Token budget allocation (200K limit)
├─ Resource availability (all required agents ready)
└─ Database/external dependency review (MCP registry compliance)
```

**Blockers:**
- ❌ Unauthorized external API → Propose MCP wrapper or defer
- ❌ Security risk → Return to requirements phase
- ❌ Token budget exceeded → Offer scope reduction options

**Gate:** All checks PASS → advance to Phase 1

---

## 2. Requirements Phase Workflow (Agent A: Business Strategist)

### **Inputs**
- Structured brief (from orchestrator)
- Shared intelligence (pitfalls.md, patterns.md, decisions.md)
- Existing codebase (if enhancement project)

### **Core Tasks**
1. **Write PRD** (Product Requirements Document)
   - Problem statement
   - User personas (3-5)
   - User stories with acceptance criteria
   - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
   - Success metrics (OKR format: Objective + Key Results)

2. **Create User Story Map**
   - Epic/Feature/Story hierarchy
   - Priority ranking (WSJF: Value/Size/Risk/Duration)
   - Dependency graph (which stories block others)

3. **Validate with Architecture** (Handoff-ready)
   - API contract overview (what endpoints needed)
   - Data entities (preliminary list)
   - Integration points (existing services)

### **Output Deliverable** (→ repo)

---

## 6. Deployment Workflow (Agent E: DevOps)

### **Inputs**
- Tested & approved code
- QA report (from Agent D)
- Handoff notes from Agent D
- Shared infrastructure (MCP servers, databases)

### **Core Tasks**
1. **Staging Deployment**
   - Deploy to staging environment (replica of production)
   - Run smoke tests (critical path only)
   - Verify monitoring & alerting
   - Database migration validation (if applicable)

2. **Documentation**
   - Deployment runbook (step-by-step)
   - Rollback procedure (if needed)
   - Monitoring dashboard (what to watch)
   - Incident response (escalation path)

3. **Production Readiness**
   - Infrastructure-as-Code (Docker, Kubernetes, IaC)
   - Environment variables (dev vs. staging vs. prod)
   - Secrets management (encrypted, audited)
   - Backup & recovery plan

4. **Post-Deployment**
   - Health checks (is service up? Is DB reachable?)
   - Monitoring setup (logs, metrics, traces)
   - Alerting setup (thresholds, notification channels)

### **Deployment Artifact** (→ repo)
```
deploy/
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
├── kubernetes.yaml
├── runbook.md
└── monitoring-dashboard.json
```

### **Deployment Gate**
- [ ] Staging tests pass (100%)
- [ ] Runbook is clear & tested
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Monitoring is live
- [ ] Secrets are encrypted
- [ ] Team trained (if new service)

### **Handoff to Orchestrator**
- Write: `shared-intelligence/handoffs/devops-to-orchestrator.md`
  - Deployment status (ready for production)
  - Risk assessment (any known issues?)
  - Rollback readiness
  - Monitoring alarms configured

**Gate:** Orchestrator + Product Manager → Go/No-Go decision

---

## 7. Post-Deployment Workflow

- [ ] All deliverables complete
- [ ] All quality gates passed
- [ ] Documentation is accurate
- [ ] Team knows how to operate service

### **Production Monitoring** (First 24-48 hours)
- Monitor error rates, latency, resource usage
- Have runbook ready for quick response
- Plan post-incident review (if any issues)

### **Success Closure**
- Update `shared-intelligence/decisions.md` with final outcomes
- Log lessons learned → `shared-intelligence/pitfalls.md`
- Promote reusable patterns → `shared-intelligence/patterns.md`
- Archive handoff notes

---

## 8. Handoff Protocol (Standard Template)

All handoffs follow this structure:

```markdown
# Handoff: [FROM_AGENT] → [TO_AGENT]
**Date:** [DATE] | **Project:** [NAME] | **Task:** [TASK_ID]

## What's Done
- [ ] [Deliverable 1]
- [ ] [Deliverable 2]
- [ ] [Deliverable 3]

## What's Assumed
- Assumption 1
- Assumption 2

## What Needs Validation
- Validation point 1
- Validation point 2

## Questions for Next Agent
- Q1: [Question]
- Q2: [Question]

## Artifacts
- [Location of PRD, code, tests, etc.]

## Blocking Issues (if any)
- [Issue description + recommended action]
```

---

## 9. Decision Gate Protocol

**Every major decision goes through:**

1. **Proposer writes:** One-page proposal (problem, options, recommendation)
2. **Stakeholders review:** 5-min async window
3. **Orchestrator decides:** Approve, ask more info, or reject
4. **Log in ADR:** `shared-intelligence/decisions.md` (ADR format)
5. **Notify affected agents:** Async message in consultation bus

**Time-critical decisions (>30 min impact):**
- Escalate immediately
- Orchestrator makes call
- Document "Decision made under time pressure"

---

## 10. Failure & Recovery Workflow

### **If Task Fails**
1. **Log failure** → `shared-intelligence/decisions.md` (root cause + context)
2. **Retry with modification** (max 3 retries)
3. **If still failing** → Escalate to orchestrator
4. **Orchestrator decides:** Fallback to backup agent, task deferral, or scope cut

### **If Quality Gate Fails**
1. **Agent fixes issue** (if agent-level problem)
2. **Re-run quality gate** (automated if possible)
3. **If persistent** → Escalate to Product Manager + Orchestrator

### **If Production Issue Post-Deployment**
1. **Incident lead:** Gather facts (what happened, user impact, timing)
2. **Rollback or hotfix?** (Orchestrator decision)
3. **Root cause analysis:** Log in `shared-intelligence/decisions.md`
4. **Prevention:** Add to `shared-intelligence/pitfalls.md`

---

## 11. Cross-Project Synchronization

**For dependent projects:**

```
Project A —[API]→ Project B
           \[Data]→ Project C

Sync points:
1. Project A: API spec + mock server (for B & C to test against)
2. Project B: Ready to integrate (calls A)
3. Project C: Ready to integrate (reads A data)
4. Integration test: All 3 projects together
```

**Protocol:**
- Spec-first: A must publish API spec before B/C development
- Mock first: A provides mock server for parallel development
- Integration late: Real integration only after both sides ready
- Test together: E2E tests must validate all 3 projects

---

## 12. Knowledge Preservation (Mandatory)

After EVERY task completion:

1. **Pitfall added** → `shared-intelligence/pitfalls.md`
   - What went wrong (if anything)
   - Prevention rule for future

2. **Pattern added** (if reusable) → `shared-intelligence/patterns.md`
   - Pattern name
   - Problem it solves
   - Code example (link to repo)

3. **Decision logged** → `shared-intelligence/decisions.md`
   - What was decided
   - Why (alternatives considered)
   - When + by whom
   - Reference to related artifacts

4. **Cost logged** → `shared-intelligence/cost-log.md`
   - Tokens used (per phase)
   - Estimated cost
   - Efficiency ratio (output value / cost)

---

**Version history:**
- v1.0: 2026-02-22 (Initial phase-based workflow)
- v2.0: 2026-02-25 (Governance v3.0 alignment — handoff protocol, shared intelligence obligations)
