## Conclusion

Partnerships are force multipliers. A single partnership with Shopify could drive 1,000+ customers. But they require:
- Clear value prop (why should they partner with us?)
- Credibility (why should they trust us?)
- Execution (actual follow-through)
- Patience (3-6 months to mature)

Start with tier 1 (platform integrations), move to tier 2 (channels), then tier 3 (content). Maintain a living partnership pipeline so there's always new growth channels being tested.
