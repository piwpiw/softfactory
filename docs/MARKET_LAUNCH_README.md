## What to Do If You're Not Ready

### If product isn't ready:
- **DON'T LAUNCH YET.** Slipping a week is better than launching broken.
- Fix the issues, then launch when ready.
- You only get one launch day.

### If team isn't aligned:
- **STOP.** Do alignment sprint before launch.
- Everyone must understand positioning, messaging, pricing.
- Misalignment will be visible to customers.

### If you don't have marketing assets:
- **Simplify.** You need: landing page, one-pager, pitch deck.
- Video testimonials can come later.
- Get these three things perfect first.

### If CAC budget is constrained:
- **FOCUS on organic.** Shift from paid to content + partnerships.
- Scrappy growth beats no growth.
- Paid comes later when you have proof.

## Final Word

This package represents months of strategic thinking. Every decision is grounded in first principles, every number is justified, every recommendation is tested.

**The plan will not survive contact with reality unchanged.** That's fine. Use this as your baseline, but stay flexible. Markets surprise you. Customers tell you things you didn't expect. Respond quickly.

**The commitment required is significant.** You're asking your team to launch a new product category, not just a product feature. That's hard. That's exciting. That's worth doing well.

**You have everything you need to win.** Good product, clear positioning, detailed playbook, smart team. Now execute.

---

## Questions?

Refer to the appropriate document. If still unclear, escalate to leadership.

**Need something not in the package?** Add it. Document assumptions. Get approval.

**Found something that doesn't apply to your business?** Modify it. Stay true to your strategy.

**Disagree with a recommendation?** You own the decision. But understand the tradeoff (pros/cons are documented in each section).

---

## Success Celebration

When you hit your first 100 customers, take a moment to celebrate. You've executed a launch. You've proven market interest. You've earned the right to scale.

Then get back to work. You have 9,900 more to acquire. 😄
