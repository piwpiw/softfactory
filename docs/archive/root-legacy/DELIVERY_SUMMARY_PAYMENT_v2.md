## Production Deployment Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] Create AWS S3 bucket with versioning
- [ ] Configure IAM user with S3-only permissions
- [ ] Set up CloudFront distribution
- [ ] Enable S3 server-side encryption (KMS)
- [ ] Create Stripe webhook endpoint
- [ ] Configure Stripe subscription products
- [ ] Run database migrations (alembic)
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Manual API testing (all 10 endpoints)
- [ ] Load testing (100+ concurrent requests)
- [ ] Backup existing data
- [ ] Train support team
- [ ] Monitor error rates & latency

## Performance Notes

**Typical Response Times:**
- File upload (10MB): 2-3 seconds
- Invoice generation & PDF: 1-2 seconds
- S3 upload: 500-1000ms
- Presigned URL generation: 100-200ms
- Payment history retrieval: 300-500ms

**Database Query Optimization:**
- Indexed on: user_id, status, created_at
- Eager loading: FileUpload relationships
- Pagination: Implemented for all list endpoints

---

## Security Implementation

✅ **Authentication:** JWT token required on all endpoints
✅ **Authorization:** User ownership checks on file/invoice access
✅ **Input Validation:** File type whitelist, size limits, amount validation
✅ **File Upload:** Restricted MIME types, no executable files
✅ **Error Messages:** Sanitized, no path/system info disclosure
✅ **IAM Policy:** Least privilege S3 bucket policy
✅ **Database:** No direct SQL injection (ORM protection)

---

**Recommended:**
- [ ] Email notifications on invoice generation
- [ ] Bulk invoice generation

## Support & Troubleshooting

### S3 Connection Issues
```
Error: S3 bucket not found
Solution: Check AWS_S3_BUCKET env var and IAM permissions
```

### PDF Generation Errors
```
Error: ReportLab unable to write PDF
Solution: Ensure reportlab>=4.0.0 is installed
```

### Stripe Integration
```
Error: Stripe API key missing
Solution: Set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY in .env, use test keys in dev
```
