## Canonical Status Snapshot

- Codebase maturity: high
- Documentation consistency: medium (actively being normalized)
- Local run readiness: high
- Production deployment readiness: medium

## Verified Facts

- Backend framework: Flask + SQLAlchemy + Flask-Migrate
- App factory: `backend/app.py`
- Registered blueprints in app factory: 28
- Route decorators in backend (raw count): 442
- OpenAPI documented paths (`docs/openapi.json`): 62
- Runtime ports in active scripts:
  - `run.py` -> 8000
  - `start_platform.py` -> 9000
  - docker-compose API -> 8000
- Health endpoint: `GET /health`
- Admin metrics endpoint: `GET /api/admin/metrics` (auth + admin)

## Delivery State (Practical)

- Functional implementation: mostly complete
- Integration depth: broad
- Test assets: broad (unit/integration/e2e + top-level suites)
- Ops assets: broad (docker, monitoring, workflows)

## Risks Remaining

- Historical markdown reports still contain conflicting completion claims.
- API quick-reference docs previously diverged from real route names in a few areas.
- Multiple deployment workflows exist; teams must use one canonical path per environment.
- Dev/demo fallback secrets remain in parts of config and should be hardened before production.
- Search query payloads for `/api/search` and advanced filters were accepted with weak coercion.

## Current Direction

1. Keep documentation aligned with executable code only.
2. Preserve backward compatibility for existing runtime behavior.
3. Treat changes as non-breaking unless covered by tests and health checks.
4. Use staged rollout and rollback guardrails for deployment changes.

## 2026-02-28 Search Stability Improvements Applied

- `/api/search` and `/api/search/advanced` now enforce safe numeric parsing and index/sort field validation.
- `per_page` is now explicitly bounded in search queries (1~100) and passed through to Elasticsearch pagination.
- Advanced query operators/fields are validated before constructing Elasticsearch boolean queries.
- Similar error paths now avoid leaking internal exception strings while preserving diagnostics in server logs.

## 2026-02-28 MCP Rationalization Applied

- MCP status is now reality-based in `orchestrator/mcp-registry.md` using:
  - `Configured` (in active MCP profiles: `.mcp.json`, `.mcp.core.json`, `.mcp.optional.json`)
  - `Ready` (env key presence)
  - `Used` (executable integration evidence)
- `claude` server mismatch resolved: now explicitly tracked in registry.
- Core recommendation fixed to fetch, filesystem, sqlite.
- Optional and removal-candidate MCPs are now explicitly separated to reduce configuration noise.
- New profile files added:
  - `.mcp.core.json` (minimal)
  - `.mcp.optional.json` (optional/on-demand)

## 2026-02-27 Normalization Applied

- Canonical CI/CD workflows are now fixed to:
  - `ci.yml`
  - `security.yml`
  - `deploy-staging.yml`
  - `deploy-production.yml`
- Legacy duplicate workflows are disabled (manual trigger only, explicit fail message):
  - `deploy.yml`, `build.yml`, `test.yml`, `lint.yml`
- JWT signing now blocks missing `PLATFORM_SECRET_KEY` in production (`backend/auth.py`).
- OAuth redirect URIs no longer silently default to localhost in production (`backend/config.py`).
- `scripts/generate_openapi.py` now generates a real route-derived `docs/openapi.json`.
