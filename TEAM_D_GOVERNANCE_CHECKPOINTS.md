# Team D — Governance Enforcement Checkpoints
> **Role:** Cross-Validation Team (QA + Governance Compliance)
> **Responsibility:** Verify all teams comply with 15 principles + sign off before merge
> **Authority:** Can request rework if governance non-compliant; escalate to Orchestrator if unresolved

---

## Your Mission

**Goal:** Ensure every team's output is production-ready AND governance-compliant before merge.

**Authority:** Enforce Principles 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 11, 14, 15 via cross-validation.

**Timeline:** Cross-validation phase starts Hour 2 (after Team B delivers template).

---

## Pre-Execution Setup (Do This NOW)

### 1. Create QUALITY_GATE_CHECKLIST.md
Save this as `D:\Project\QUALITY_GATE_CHECKLIST.md` for all teams to use:

```markdown
# Quality Gate Checklist — [Team Name]
> **Project:** Infrastructure Improvement | **Date:** 2026-02-25
> **Validator:** Team D | **Status:** ☐ PENDING (☐ PASS / ☐ FAIL / ☐ REWORK REQUIRED)

### 2. Create Governance Validation Rubric

Save as `D:\Project\GOVERNANCE_VALIDATION_RUBRIC.md`:

```markdown
# Governance Validation Rubric — Team D
> **Purpose:** Scoring framework for governance compliance
> **Scoring:** 0 (fail) → 1 (partial) → 2 (pass) → 3 (exemplary)

## Scoring Scale

| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 0 | Non-compliant | FAIL — Reject, request rework |
| 1 | Partial compliance | CONDITIONAL PASS — Escalate to Orchestrator |
| 2 | Compliant | PASS — Approve for merge |
| 3 | Exemplary | PASS + BONUS — Document pattern reuse |

## Rubric per Principle

### Principle 2: CLAUDE.md Authority Chaining
**Score 2:** All files include Layer 1-5 imports at top; or inherit from parent module
**Score 1:** Some files missing imports; imports incomplete (only Layers 1-3)
**Score 0:** No imports; agents act without reading constitution

### Principle 3: MCP-Only Connections
**Score 2:** MCP audit provided; zero direct imports (e.g., sqlite3, requests, httpx); all external calls via MCP
**Score 1:** Mostly MCP compliant; 1-2 minor direct imports (utilities only, not core logic)
**Score 0:** Direct DB imports, ad-hoc HTTP calls, undeclared external dependencies

### Principle 4: Hooks Active
**Score 2:** cost-log.md shows pre/post tool use timestamps; hooks fired correctly
**Score 1:** Hooks attempted but some entries missing; cost-log incomplete
**Score 0:** No hook evidence in cost-log.md

### Principle 6: Quality Gates
**Score 2:** Lint 0 warnings, type check pass, coverage ≥80%, secret scan clean
**Score 1:** Lint/type warnings present but minor (<5); coverage 70-79%; secrets reviewed
**Score 0:** Lint errors, type check fail, coverage <70%, secrets found

### Principle 9: Shared Intelligence Updates
**Score 2:** All 4 files updated (pitfalls, patterns, decisions, handoff); proper format (PF-/PAT-/ADR-)
**Score 1:** 2-3 files updated; format partially correct
**Score 0:** 0-1 files updated; missing mandatory post-task updates

### Principle 11: Sub-Project Template (Team B Only)
**Score 2:** SUBPROJECT_CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md complete; includes all 11 sections; import chaining example
**Score 1:** Template present but missing sections; examples unclear
**Score 0:** No template delivered

### Principle 15: Reuse-First Pattern
**Score 2:** Evidence provided (patterns.md citation + Anthropic Cookbook ref); zero reinvention
**Score 1:** Some pattern reuse; 1-2 minor reinventions
**Score 0:** No evidence of pattern checking; significant reinvention

## Overall Validation Score

**Calculation:** Sum of 7 principle scores / 21 × 100

- **90-100:** PASS — Approve for merge
- **70-89:** CONDITIONAL — Escalate to Orchestrator with recommended fixes
- **<70:** FAIL — Reject, request rework

## Example Report

```
Team: Team C (Error Tracker)
Date: 2026-02-25 14:30

Principle Scores:
  #2 (CLAUDE.md): 2 ✅
  #3 (MCP-only): 2 ✅ (audit: error_tracker_audit.md attached)
  #4 (Hooks): 2 ✅
  #6 (Quality): 1 ⚠️ (coverage 75%, need 80%; rework required)
  #9 (Shared Intel): 2 ✅ (pitfalls + patterns updated)
  #11 (Template): N/A (Team B responsibility)
  #15 (Reuse): 2 ✅ (referenced PAT-005, PAT-008)

Overall Score: 13/18 = 72% → CONDITIONAL PASS

Recommendation: Approve after Team C increases test coverage to 80% (1h rework).
Escalate to Orchestrator (Team A) for timeline adjustment.
```
```

### 3. Prepare Daily Validation Log

Create `D:\Project\shared-intelligence/TEAM_D_VALIDATION_LOG.md`:

```markdown
# Team D — Daily Governance Validation Log
> **Date:** 2026-02-25 | **Validator:** Team D | **Authority:** CLAUDE.md Section 17

## Hour 2 Checkpoint (12:00-13:00)

| Team | Deliverable | Status | Score | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|-------|
| A | Scope + OKR | ☐ PENDING | - | - |
| B | Template + structure | ☐ PENDING | - | Must deliver before Hour 3 gates |

## Hour 3 Checkpoint (13:00-14:00)

| Team | Deliverable | Status | Score | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|-------|
| C | Error tracker code | ☐ PENDING | - | Requires MCP audit |

**Last Updated:** [Timestamp]
**Next Review:** [Timestamp]
```

## Cross-Validation Protocol (Hour 2 onwards)

### Validation Sequence

```
Team A (Scope)
  ↓ validates
Team B (Template + Structure)
  ↓ validates
Team C (Error Tracker) — requires MCP audit
  ↓ parallel validates
Teams E, F, G (CI/CD, Security, Cost-Log)
  ↓ final merge validation
Team D → Orchestrator → You (Supervisor)
```

### Cross-Validation Pairs

You manage these adjacent team validations:

| Pair | Validation Gate | Pass Criteria |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| A ↔ B | Scope clarity & template alignment | Team B template reflects Team A's infrastructure scope |
| B ↔ C | Structure supports error tracker | Error tracker code fits Team B's structure cleanly |
| C ↔ D | MCP audit + governance | Team C MCP connections pass audit; zero violations |
| C ↔ E | Error tracker + CI/CD gates | Error tracker integrated into CI/CD pipeline |
| D ↔ E | QA coverage + deployment | All tests from Team D pass before Team E deployment |
| E ↔ F | Hardened CI/CD + security | No security bypass in Team E's pipeline |
| F ↔ G | Security log format + cost tracking | Security logs protected; Team G cost tracking includes security ops |

### Validation Steps Per Team

1. **Receive:** Team submits feature branch + checklist
2. **Review:** Check against QUALITY_GATE_CHECKLIST.md
3. **Score:** Apply GOVERNANCE_VALIDATION_RUBRIC.md
4. **Audit:** If governance score <2 on any principle, request evidence
5. **Validate:** Run `git diff main...feature/team-X` to spot-check code
6. **Sign-Off:** Update TEAM_D_VALIDATION_LOG.md with score + status
7. **Escalate:** If score <2 on critical principle (#3 MCP-only), escalate to Orchestrator
8. **Merge:** If score ≥2 all principles, approve merge

---

## Critical Gates (Non-Negotiable)

These **MUST** pass before merge. If any fail, escalate immediately to Orchestrator:

### Gate 1: Principle 3 (MPC-Only Connections)
**Test:** Does code use only MCP for external connections?
```bash
# Team C (Error Tracker):
grep -r "import sqlite3\|import requests\|import urllib\|import http\." backend/ web/
# Should return: ZERO matches

# Audit Check:
ls -la error_tracker_audit.md && cat error_tracker_audit.md
# Should show: MCP connection diagram, zero direct imports
```

**Pass Criteria:** `error_tracker_audit.md` present + zero direct imports found

**If Fail:** Reject — request Team C rework

### Gate 2: Principle 9 (Shared Intelligence Updates)
**Test:** Did team update post-task mandatory files?
```bash
git diff main...feature/team-X -- shared-intelligence/
# Should show: pitfalls.md, patterns.md, decisions.md changes
```

**Pass Criteria:** All 4 files updated with team-X changes

**If Fail:** Request — give team 30 min to update; escalate if refused

### Gate 3: Principle 6 (Quality Gates)
**Test:** Code quality
```bash
pytest tests/ --cov=backend --cov=web
# Coverage ≥80%

flake8 backend/ web/
# Zero warnings

mypy backend/ web/
# Type check pass

trivy scan .
# Zero critical secrets
```

**Pass Criteria:** All 4 checks pass

**If Fail:** Request — rework required before merge

---

## Special Validations

### For Team B (SUBPROJECT_CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md)
**Critical Gate:** Template includes mandatory sections

```
Template Validation Checklist:

- [ ] Section 1: Project Title + Scope-In (1 sentence)
- [ ] Section 2: Scope-Out (1 sentence)
- [ ] Section 3: Authority Boundaries (link to agent-registry.md)
- [ ] Section 4: IMPORTS block (Layer 1-5 for sub-project)
- [ ] Section 5: Tech Stack Checklist
- [ ] Section 6: Success Metrics (measurable, time-bound)
- [ ] Section 7: Inherited shared-intelligence/ (pitfalls, patterns, decisions)
- [ ] Section 8: Escalation Path (to parent Orchestrator)
- [ ] Section 9: Example (M-002 CooCook or equivalent)
- [ ] Section 10: Version History

Template must be usable as-is for M-005+ sub-projects (Team A copies it).
```

**If Missing:** Request Team B complete before Team C starts.

### For Team C (Error Tracker + MCP Audit)
**Critical Gate:** MCP connection diagram

Create `error_tracker_audit.md` with:
```markdown
# Error Tracker MCP Audit — Team C

## Architecture Diagram
```
[MCP Connection Diagram]
error_tracker_service.py
  ↓
  MCP-02 (sequential-thinking) — error analysis logic
  MCP-04 (sqlite) — error log queries (read-only)
  MCP-03 (memory) — session state (optional)

  ✅ Zero direct DB imports
  ✅ Zero ad-hoc HTTP calls
  ✅ All external connections via MCP
```

## Code Audit
- No `import sqlite3` ✅
- No `import requests` ✅
- No direct database URI ✅

## Test Coverage
- error_tracker_service.py: 85% ✅
- Includes edge cases (duplicate errors, malformed input) ✅
```

**If Missing:** Reject — error tracker cannot merge without audit.

---

## Escalation Criteria

### When to Escalate to Orchestrator (Team A)

1. **Governance Score <2 on Principles 2, 3, 6, 9, 15**
   - Impact: Code cannot merge
   - Action: Escalate with rubric score + recommendation

2. **Quality Gate Fail (Coverage <80%, lint errors, secrets found)**
   - Impact: Production risk
   - Action: Escalate with remediation plan

3. **Merge Conflict Unresolvable**
   - Impact: Cannot integrate 7-team changes
   - Action: Escalate for manual conflict resolution decision

4. **Timeline Slipping**
   - Impact: Hour X checkpoint missed
   - Action: Escalate with delay analysis + revised timeline

5. **Cost Overrun (Team >allocated tokens)**
   - Impact: Budget breach
   - Action: Escalate to Team G + Orchestrator for cost-saving decision

### Escalation Message Template

```
To: Orchestrator (Team A)
From: Team D
Subject: [ESCALATION] [Team X] — [Principle #N] Non-Compliant

Status: BLOCKED

Team: [X]
Deliverable: [Name]
Issue: [Principle #N description] — [specific failure]
Evidence: [File + line number / metric]

Governance Rubric Score: [0-3]
Recommendation: [rework / investigate / timeline adjust / cost review]

Blocker Resolution Options:
1. Team rework (estimate: X hours)
2. Escalate to Supervisor (you) for override (not recommended)
3. Cut feature from scope (if non-critical)

Awaiting decision.
```
