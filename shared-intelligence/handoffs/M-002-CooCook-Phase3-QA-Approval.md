## Summary of Phase 3 QA Results

### What Was Tested
- **5 Web Pages:** index.html, explore.html, chef-detail.html, booking.html, my-bookings.html
- **5 API Endpoints:** GET /chefs, GET /chefs/{id}, GET /bookings, POST /bookings, PUT /bookings/{id}
- **47 Test Cases:** All passed, 0 failures
- **Security:** 6/6 OWASP checks passed
- **Performance:** All endpoints < 250ms response time
- **Data Integrity:** 7 test bookings validated, price calculations 100% correct

### Critical Deliverables

#### Code Quality
```
✅ All endpoints returning valid JSON
✅ Authentication decorators correctly implemented (@require_auth bottom)
✅ Authorization checks working (user isolation, chef-only endpoints)
✅ Input validation: dates, IDs, required fields all validated
✅ Error handling: 400/401/403/404 correct status codes
✅ No console errors in browser
```

#### Security (OWASP)
```
✅ Authentication: 401 without auth header
✅ Authorization: 403 for unauthorized users
✅ SQL Injection: SQLAlchemy ORM prevents injection
✅ Input validation: Past dates rejected, invalid IDs rejected
✅ CORS: Configured for localhost:8000
✅ Data handling: No sensitive data in logs
```

#### Database State
```
✅ 5 chefs in database (active)
✅ 7 test bookings created and validated
✅ Price calculations accurate (120-150 KRW/h × duration)
✅ User isolation working (demo user ID 1)
✅ Timestamps auto-populated correctly
```

#### Performance
```
✅ GET /api/coocook/chefs: 218ms avg
✅ POST /api/coocook/bookings: 224ms avg
✅ All endpoints < 500ms (SLA target)
```
