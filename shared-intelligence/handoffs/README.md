# Handoff Protocol
> **Purpose:** Explicit handoff notes between agents on dependent task chains.
> **Requirement:** Write handoff notes before closing any task that has a downstream agent.
> **Format:** One file per task chain — `[task-id]-handoff.md`

---

## Handoff Rules

1. **When to write:** Any task with a downstream dependency (Phase 1 → Phase 2, Agent A → Agent B)
2. **What to include:**
   - What was completed (factual, no speculation)
   - Known blockers or open questions
   - Next agent's first action
   - Critical files changed
3. **Where:** This directory — `shared-intelligence/handoffs/[task-id]-handoff.md`
4. **When to read:** Every agent reads their incoming handoff BEFORE starting work
