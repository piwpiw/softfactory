## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Environment (5 min)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/piwpiw/jarvis.git
cd jarvis
git checkout clean-main
git pull origin clean-main
git tag -l | grep v1.0-infrastructure-upgrade
git describe --tags
```

### Step 2: Build Docker Image (15 min)

```bash
docker build -t softfactory:v1.0-infrastructure-upgrade \
  --build-arg RELEASE_TAG=v1.0-infrastructure-upgrade \
  .

docker images | grep v1.0-infrastructure-upgrade
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Staging (15 min)

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e ENVIRONMENT=staging \
  -e LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG \
  --name softfactory-staging \
  softfactory:v1.0-infrastructure-upgrade

docker ps | grep softfactory-staging
```

### Step 4: Smoke Testing (10 min)

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/health
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/metrics/health
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/errors/health

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/errors \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"error_type":"test","message":"deployment test"}'
```

### Step 5: Monitor Staging (30 min)

```bash
docker logs -f softfactory-staging
docker stats softfactory-staging
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/errors/recent
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/metrics/tokens
```

### Step 6: Production Deployment (5 min)

```bash
docker stop softfactory-staging
docker rm softfactory-staging

docker run -d \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e ENVIRONMENT=production \
  -e LOG_LEVEL=WARNING \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --name softfactory-prod \
  softfactory:v1.0-infrastructure-upgrade

docker ps | grep softfactory-prod
```

### Step 7: Post-Deployment Validation (10 min)

```bash
for endpoint in /health /api/metrics/health /api/errors/health
do
  echo "Testing $endpoint..."
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8000$endpoint || echo "FAILED"
done

curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/errors/recent | jq '.'
docker logs softfactory-prod | tail -20
```

---

## Rollback Procedure

If deployment fails:

```bash
docker stop softfactory-prod
docker rm softfactory-prod

git checkout clean-main
git reset --hard eb0b14a4
git push -f origin clean-main

docker build -t softfactory:v0.9-stable .
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --restart unless-stopped softfactory:v0.9-stable
```
